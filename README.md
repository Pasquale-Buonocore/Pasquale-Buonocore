## ðŸš€ Welcome to my Github!

I am Pasquale Buonocore, a **Mechatronics Engineer** living his third working year experience as **model based embedded software designer** and **tester engineer**.
I am mainly involved in production and research projects both in groups and independently, which requires a variety set of skills ranging from Matlab/Simulink/StateFlow to C/C++ and python programming languages! Follow me on my social for more!

## :zap: My free time activities

Since a couple of years, I have been interested in the Web3 world, the personal finance and investment sectors. For that reason I have been working on an application to track the earnings and expenses of a user as well as his investments. The SW is python programmed and kivy is used for the user interface. I plan to deliver the first alpha in the next months.

Besides that, I am slowly falling in love with the Rust programming language and the new paradigm and point of view it is trying to bring to life when programming embedded systems.

## Repository objective

Little by little the repo will become a reference full of examples and documentation for:
- Matlab Simulink Stateflow and best practices to follow when programming according to a model based design approach.
- Documentation and examples with python and its libraries such as Kivy, pillow, beautifoulSoup, mysqllite3, Mongodb.
- Documentation and examples with C/C++ and its libraries. I would love to focus on ROS and UE5, let's see what I will be able to do!
- Documentation and examples with Rust. I will try to write Smart Contract on rust developed chains: Elrond, Near Protocol, Solana ect.
