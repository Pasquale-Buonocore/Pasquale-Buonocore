## Welcome to my Github!

I am Pasquale Buonocore, a **Mechatronics Engineer** living his third working year experience as **model based embedded software designer** and **tester engineer**.
I am mainly involved in prodution and research project both in groups and independently, which requires a variety set of skill randing from Matlab/Simulink/StateFlow to C/C++ and python programming languages! Follow me on my social for more!

Since a couple of years I have joined the Web3 world, the personal finance and investment sectors. For that reason I have been working on an application to track your earning and expeces as well as your investiment both in the tradition and decentralized field. 
The SW is python programmed whereas kivy is used for the user interface. I plan to deliver a first alpha in the next months.

Beside that, I am slowly falling in love with the Rust programming language and the new paradigm and point of view it is trying to bring to life.

## Repository objective

Little by little the repo will become a reference full of examples and documentation for:
- Matlab Simulink Stateflow, as well as the best practises to follow when programming according to a MBD apprach. (DO178C, DO331, MISCRA C)
- Documentation and examples with python and its libraris such as Kivy, pillow, beautifoulSoup, mysqllite3, Mongodb ect.
- Documentation and examples with C/C++ and its libraries. I would love to focus on ROS and UE5, let's see what I will be able to do!
- Documentation and examples with Rust. I will try to write Smart Contract on rust developed chains: Elrond, Near Protocol, Solana for example.
