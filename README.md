## ðŸš€ Welcome to my Github!

**Mechatronics Engineer** living his fourth working year experience as **Embedded software engineer**.
I am mainly involved in production and research projects in groups and independently, which requires various skills ranging from Matlab/Simulink/StateFlow to C/C++ and python programming languages!

## :zap: My free time activities
I am slowly falling in love with the Rust programming language and the new paradigm it is trying to bring to life when programming embedded systems.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Repository objective

Little by little the repo will become a reference full of examples and documentation for:
- Matlab Simulink Stateflow and best practices to follow when programming according to a model-based design approach.
- Documentation and examples with Python and its libraries such as Kivy, pillow, beautifoulSoup, mysqllite3, and Mongodb.
- Documentation and examples with C/C++ and its libraries. I would love to focus on ROS, UE5 and robotics!
- Documentation and examples with Rust. I will try to write Smart Contracts on rust-developed chains: Elrond, Near Protocol, Solana.
