## üöÄ About Me

üéì I am Pasquale Buonocore, a **Mechatronics Engineer** living his third working year experience as **model based designer** software designer, tester and embedded.
I daily use Matlab-Simulink-StateFlow as main programming language, in addition to C/C++ and python.

I am also in love with programming and this repository was born to perse such passion. In fact, you can easily find out that the repositories I am mostly active on are:

Since a couple of years I have joined the Web3 world, investment and personal finance and for that reason I have been working on an application to track your earning and expeces as well as your investiment both in the tradition and decentralized field. I am programming it using python and kivy for the UI. MySql and MongoDB as databases.
I plan to deliver a first alpha in the next months.

Onther subject I would love to deepen is of course the Rust programming language, which seems to deal with the classical programming problems starting from a different point of View. 

## üõ†Ô∏è Repository objective

Little by little the repo will become a reference full of examples and documentation for:
- Matlab Simulink Stateflow, as well as the best practise to follow when programming according to a MBD apprach.
- Documentation and examples for python and its library such as Kivy, pillow, beautifoulSoup, mysqllite3, Mongodb ect
- Documentation and examples for C/C++
- Documentation and examples for Rust
